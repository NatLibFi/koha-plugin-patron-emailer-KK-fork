This plugin takes a csv file that must include a Koha borrower cardnumber and an email address and uses that info to send an email, specified in the tool configuration, to all of the patrons in the file.

When configuring the email, template tooklit syntax is used to display any column names in the csv file.

i.e. columns (firstname, surname, email, fines, libraryname)

Email body:
*****************************************************
Dear [% firstname %] [%surname%],

You have a balance of $[% fines %]

Please pay these at [% libraryname %] 
****************************************************

The spreadsheet can be generated from a report in koha, or by hand.
